# **CHAPTER 2-Understanding Seasonal Variations of Carbon Use Efficiency and Autotrophic Respiration Using Eddy Covariance Observations**

**Overview:** Carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of net primary production (NPP, where NPP = GPP − R~a~) to gross primary production (GPP), is a key indicator of how efficiently ecosystems convert assimilated carbon into biomass. Due to the challenges of directly measuring NPP, CUE has often been assumed to be nearly constant across ecosystems over the past two decades. As a result, little attention has been given to its seasonal or temporal variability. However, a recent study has introduced new methods to estimate NPP and autotrophic respiration (R~a~) by using ecosystem respiration (R~eco~) and GPP derived from eddy covariance (EC) data. These approaches suggest that CUE can vary significantly among ecosystems and over time. In this study, I apply this novel method using the refined GPP and R~eco~ data from previous chapter to investigate the seasonal dynamics of both CUE and R~a~.

Shifts in plant respiration and carbon use efficiency at a large-scale drought experiment in the eastern Amazon (Metcalfe et al., 2010)

Research gap and question: The effects of drought upon ecosystem structure and function in the Amazon are potentially large but remain poorly defined.-\> A range of studies from drought experiments in the Amazon have examined numerous C cycle components in isolation, but none have yet synthesized these individual components to construct a full C budget of a droughted Amazon forest. In this study, to examine the impacts of a large-scale through-fall exclusion (TFE) treatment in an eastern Amazon primary rainforest on ecosystem C cycling and partitioning.

Related Concepts: Plant Carbon Expenditure (PCE), total C plants use for processes like respiration and growth: PCE = NPP + Ra Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the total quantity of C entering the forest via photosynthesis GPP \~ PCE \~ Reco under steady-state conditions NTP (net change in tree C balance) = PCE - GPP NTP tells us whether trees are gaining C (NTP \< 0), losing C (NTP \> 0) or in balance (NTP \~ 0)

Methods: 1 ha plot (TFE plot) was modified by the installation of plastic panels placed at 1–2 m above the ground,

Carbon Component How It Was Quantified (Key Method + Instrument) Canopy NPP: Monthly litterfall traps; LAI from hemispherical photos; LMA from harvested leaves. Stem & branch NPP: Annual DBH measurements; biomass from allometric equations; branch fall from transects. Fine root NPP: Soil cores (0–30 cm); roots washed, dried, weighed. Coarse root NPP: Deep soil pits (to 3 m); biomass scaled using depth/diameter ratios. DOC export: Literature value from Amazon catchment study. VOC / CH₄ emissions: Literature-based estimate (no field measurements). Leaf respiration: Leaf gas exchange using portable IRGA chambers (dark respiration). Stem respiration: Literature respiration rates scaled by stem surface area. Soil respiration: Closed dynamic chambers + IRGA; monthly CO₂ efflux at 25 points per plot. Dead wood respiration: Chamber-based CO₂ efflux measurements on woody debris pieces.

Main Findings:

**ABOUT CUE**

Greater Reco in the TFE plot was mainly attributable to the higher Rauto flux of 25.8 ± 3.4 t C ha)1 yr)1 compared with 22.4 ± 2.8 t C ha-1 yr-1 in the control

Total estimated NPP was 2.4 ± 1.4 t C ha-1 yr-1 lower on the TFE plot relative to the control (Table 2, Fig. 3a).

**CUE = NPP/Ra+NPP, with precipitation, Ra increases, NPP decreases, Ra increases bigger than NPP decreases, denominator larger CUE decreases**

The TFE treatment was associated with a lower CUE in all plant organs, but particularly canopy CUE (control, 0.41 ± 0.07; TFE, 0.30 ± 0.07). The overall effect was a lower ecosystem CUE in the TFE plot of 0.24 ± 0.04 compared with 0.32 ± 0.04 in the control plot (Table 2, Fig. 4).

Drought reduced carbon allocation to roots and/or increased root mortality, leading to lower below-ground biomass.

### Specific Studies

**Two 1 ha plots (drainage shallow soils vs. humid amazonian forests) in Southern Amazonian Forests in Bolivia (Araujo-Murakami et al., 2013)**

Tropical forests with CUE near 0.3, which is lower than temperate forests 0.5 as 1) old-growth systems and a higher CUE is associated with recovery from disturbance or systems are naturally more dynamics\
\
Southern Amazon: dry, less studied\
Central and eastern: more humid, most large-scale C cycling measurements have taken place\
NPP in tropical forests: allocation patterns were fairly consistent across sites, little variance in canopy allocation but shifting allocation between fine roots and woody tissue NPP\
\
Differences between long-term and short-term disturbances:\
Long-term drought (Metcalfe et a., 2010): lower CUE\
Single disturbance event (Malhi et al., 2009): increase CUE as more C is allocated to biomass production during recovery phase

Research Qs: 1) how do seasonal cycles of components of Ra and NPP vary between two plots? 2) what is total budget of NPP and respiration, and how does this budget varies between humid and more xeric plot? 3) Do C allocation patterns and CUE differ between humid and dry plots?\
\
Site Specifics:\
- relatively high fertility\
- low acidity\
- Two plots (Kenia-wet, Kenia-dry)\
Kenia-wet: deeper soils, large trees, typical Amazon biome\
Kenia-dry: higher wood density, thorny branches, small leaves, humid amazon forest zone

Results:\
**Peak** of rainy season: December to February\
Dry season (less than 100 mm rainfall yr-1): April to September\
coldest temperatures (as austral winter): May-July\
\
1) Fine root NPP: Kenia-**wet** had significantly more total fine root NPP than Kenia-dry\
2) Aboveground woody NPP: kenia-**dry** is higher\
3) Canopy-NPP (total litterfall): Kenia-dry vs **wet** during dry (0.30 vs. 0.66)\
4) Branch turnover NPP: overall similar (wet\>dry a bit?), strong seasonal cycle\
5) Ra (Rleaves, Rstems, Rrhizo) lower over the dry seasons\
6) Woody respiration was significantly greater at Kenia-wet (P \< 0.05)\
7) Kenia-dry had lower LAI and lower average leaf photosynthesis than Kenia-wet (The abundant drought-deciduous trees in Kenia-dry lost most of their leaves in the dry season)\
8）NPP higher at wet compared to dry (15.50 ± 0.89 vs. 11.27 ± 0.68), Ra higher at wet compared to dry (18.64 ± 2.78 vs. 15.61 ± 2.61)；CUE 0.45 ± 0.05 at Kenia-wet vs. 0.42 ± 0.05 at Kenia-dry

Hints: Decreased in precipitation with decreased in solar radiation-\>further decrease photosynthesis\
The evergreen Kenia-wet plot displays strong seasonality in leaf flush with a bimodal peak in March and October, new leaves are flushing to coincide with the peaks in radiation, this has similarities to sites in the eastern Amazon, where leaf flush tends to correspond with the dry season, with highest sunlight.

**First study in western Amazonia, 2 1 ha plots in south-eastern Peru (CUE = NPP/PCE) (Malhi et al., 2014)**

Research Qs:

(1) How do the components of NPP vary over the seasonal cycle in these two plots, and how do they relate to climate conditions?
(2) How do the components of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration vary over the seasonal cycle in these two plots, and how do they relate to climate conditions?
(3) How does the total cycle of carbon production, carbon-use efficiency (the ratio of NPP to GPP) and NPP allocation differ between the plots, and compare with previously published results from Brazilian Amazonia?

\- higher wood productivity, turnover and different species composition and lower wood density compared to eastern Amazonian forests

Study Sites:\
TAM-05 VS. TAM-06\
Peak of the rainy season: December to February\
Dry season (\<100mm/month): May-September\
Solar radiation: late dry, early wet season, August-November\
SWC: TAM-05 21.8% (more sand) Vs. TAM-06 35.5%

Main Findings:\
- Leaf fall rise in mid-dry season, peaking at the end of the dry season\
- Fine root growth showed substantial seasonality in phase with the rainfall pattern, peak in peak wet season, a minimum in dry season\
- 15.0 ± 0.8 Mg C ha−1 year−1 /14.2 ± 1.0 Mg C ha−1 year−1 (TAM05/TAM06)\
- 0.42 ± 0.05/0.41 ± 0.05\
- NPP show seasonal variations, lower over dry and higher over wet\
- Ra no significant seasonality in both sites, TAM06 not significant but Ra lower over dry (when Ra decreases smaller than NPP, suggests CUE decreases)\
- CUE is highest in the wet season (October–March), being 0.37 ± 0.06/0.44 ± 0.09 in TAM-05/06, and reaches its lowest values in the wet–dry transition (April–June), being 0.29 ± 0.08/0.27 ± 0.08.\
\
Hints: In this study, assume BP is close to total actual NPP, and retain the terminology NPP for the sum of the biomass production components, and carbon use efficiency (CUE) for the ratio NPP/GPP.

Plant Carbon Expenditure (PCE) is approximated to GPP from a long term perspective but may not be equivalent to GPP if there is a substantial seasonal cycle of storage of non-structural carbohydrates (e.g. if products of “excess” GPP are stored in one season and allocated to NPP or metabolism in another season)\
\
On a seasonal timescale, we distinguish PCE from GPP, significant seasonal storage of C in the form of NSCs. NSC accumulation in dry season and depletion in wet season

**Strong seasonality in the carbon storage and carbon use efficiency of an Eastern Amazonian forest (**0.36+-0.02**)**

Site Descriptions:\
French Guiana: A long (August–November) and short (March) dry season.\
\
Methods: Data Assimilation Linked Carbon Model (DALEC) Model\
Dry season when SWC all days where the mean daily SWC was \<0.12 m-3 m-3\
GPP simulated using ACM with radiation, T, CO2, SWC, LAI, leaf nitrogen\
NPP =GPP-Ra\
Ra measured using component respiration measurements, including leaf respiration, stem respiration, root and rhizosphere respiration\
CUE = GPP-Ra/GPP

The 5% increase in CUE in the dry season was caused by a greater dry season increases in GPP (8%) than in Ra (4%; Table 3) suggesting that this forest is more efficient at investing carbon in the dry season\
