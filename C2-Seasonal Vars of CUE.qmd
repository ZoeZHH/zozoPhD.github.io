# **CHAPTER 2-Understanding Seasonal Variations of Carbon Use Efficiency and Autotrophic Respiration Using Eddy Covariance Observations**

**Overview:** Carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of net primary production (NPP, where NPP = GPP − R~a~) to gross primary production (GPP), is a key indicator of how efficiently ecosystems convert assimilated carbon into biomass. Due to the challenges of directly measuring NPP, CUE has often been assumed to be nearly constant across ecosystems over the past two decades. As a result, little attention has been given to its seasonal or temporal variability. However, a recent study has introduced new methods to estimate NPP and autotrophic respiration (R~a~) by using ecosystem respiration (R~eco~) and GPP derived from eddy covariance (EC) data. These approaches suggest that CUE can vary significantly among ecosystems and over time. In this study, I apply this novel method using the refined GPP and R~eco~ data from previous chapter to investigate the seasonal dynamics of both CUE and R~a~.

Shifts in plant respiration and carbon use efficiency at a large-scale drought experiment in the eastern Amazon (Metcalfe et al., 2010)

Research gap and question: The effects of drought upon ecosystem structure and function in the Amazon are potentially large but remain poorly defined.-\> A range of studies from drought experiments in the Amazon have examined numerous C cycle components in isolation, but none have yet synthesized these individual components to construct a full C budget of a droughted Amazon forest. In this study, to examine the impacts of a large-scale through-fall exclusion (TFE) treatment in an eastern Amazon primary rainforest on ecosystem C cycling and partitioning.

Related Concepts: Plant Carbon Expenditure (PCE), total C plants use for processes like respiration and growth: PCE = NPP + Ra Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the total quantity of C entering the forest via photosynthesis GPP \~ PCE \~ Reco under steady-state conditions NTP (net change in tree C balance) = PCE - GPP NTP tells us whether trees are gaining C (NTP \< 0), losing C (NTP \> 0) or in balance (NTP \~ 0)

Methods: 1 ha plot (TFE plot) was modified by the installation of plastic panels placed at 1–2 m above the ground,

Carbon Component How It Was Quantified (Key Method + Instrument) Canopy NPP: Monthly litterfall traps; LAI from hemispherical photos; LMA from harvested leaves. Stem & branch NPP: Annual DBH measurements; biomass from allometric equations; branch fall from transects. Fine root NPP: Soil cores (0–30 cm); roots washed, dried, weighed. Coarse root NPP: Deep soil pits (to 3 m); biomass scaled using depth/diameter ratios. DOC export: Literature value from Amazon catchment study. VOC / CH₄ emissions: Literature-based estimate (no field measurements). Leaf respiration: Leaf gas exchange using portable IRGA chambers (dark respiration). Stem respiration: Literature respiration rates scaled by stem surface area. Soil respiration: Closed dynamic chambers + IRGA; monthly CO₂ efflux at 25 points per plot. Dead wood respiration: Chamber-based CO₂ efflux measurements on woody debris pieces.

Main Findings:

**ABOUT CUE**

Greater Reco in the TFE plot was mainly attributable to the higher Rauto flux of 25.8 ± 3.4 t C ha)1 yr)1 compared with 22.4 ± 2.8 t C ha-1 yr-1 in the control

Total estimated NPP was 2.4 ± 1.4 t C ha-1 yr-1 lower on the TFE plot relative to the control (Table 2, Fig. 3a).

**CUE = NPP/Ra+NPP, with precipitation, Ra increases, NPP decreases, Ra increases bigger than NPP decreases, denominator larger CUE decreases**

The TFE treatment was associated with a lower CUE in all plant organs, but particularly canopy CUE (control, 0.41 ± 0.07; TFE, 0.30 ± 0.07). The overall effect was a lower ecosystem CUE in the TFE plot of 0.24 ± 0.04 compared with 0.32 ± 0.04 in the control plot (Table 2, Fig. 4).

Drought reduced carbon allocation to roots and/or increased root mortality, leading to lower below-ground biomass.
