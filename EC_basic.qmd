## u\* filtering

At night, clear and calm conditions, atmosphere becomes stably stratified (cool air settles near ground, warm air sits above -\> suppress vertical mixing) -\> CO~2~ produced near the surface by respiration accumulation close to the ground BUT EC measure vertical fluxes of CO~2~ which rely on turbulence -\> underestimate the true respiration happening at the surface

Scientists assumes a threshold of u\* (detect the **minimum amount of turbulence** needed for reliable nighttime NEE (ecosystem respiration) measurements), two methods:\
- The moving point method (Papale et al., 2006 https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-3-571-2006):\
Seperate BINS: Only nighttime data used (R~g~ \< 10 W m-2) -\> seasonal splitting (data are split by seasons to account for changes in surface properties) -\> temperature subsets (each season is further split into 6 temperature bins using quantiles, to ensure homogeneity of respiration rates, temperature is closely related to respiration rates!) -\> within each temperature subset, u\* is divided into \~20 bins with equal number of points

Moving Point Test: For each bin i, compute mean NEE of bin i ($\mu_i$) and mean NEE of the next 10 bins ($\mu_{i+1\,\ldots\,i+10}$) -\> Check if $\mu_i > 0.95 \times \operatorname{mean}(\mu_{i+1}, \ldots, \mu_{i+10})$ and this holds for $\mu_{i+1}$-\>If so, bin i's mean u\* is the threshold\
- The breakpoint detection method
