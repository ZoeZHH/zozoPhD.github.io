## Theoretical CUE

### Understanding GPP and Ra on leaf-level

Chloroplasts are organelles that conduct photosynthesis, where the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures the energy from sunlight, converts it, and stores it in the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH while freeing oxygen from water in plant and algal cells.

In photosynthesis-light reaction stage, light-dependent reactions convert light energy (absorbed by chlorophyll) into chemical energy (NADPH and ATP) required for the Calvin Cycle.

**Step 1: Light absorption by chlorophyll**; In Photosystem II, chlorophyll absorbs about 4 photons, exciting electrons to a higher energy state. These electrons are transferred into an electron transport chain.

**Step 2: Water splitting**; The oxygen-evolving complex splits 2 water molecules into 4 electrons, 4 protons, and one oxygen molecules. The 4 electrons replace those lost from Photosystem II, the protons accumulate in the thylakoid lumen, and oxygen is released as a byproduct.

**Step 3: Electron transport chain**; 4 electrons move through plastoquinone, cytochrome b6f, and plastocyanin. This transfer drives proton pumping into the lumen, further increasing the proton gradient.

**Step 4: Photosystem I and NADPH formation**; Electrons reach Photosystem I at a lower energy level and are re-excited by light. They are passed to ferredoxin and then to NADP+ reductase, reducing 2 NADP+ to 2 NADPH.

**Step 5: ATP synthesis**; The accumulation of protons in the lumen from water splitting and proton pumping drives their return through ATP synthase, producing about three molecules of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.

In photosynthesis - calvin cycle stage, carbon fixation happened, which NADPH and ATP are used to convert CO~2~ into carbohydrates. There are three phases included: caboxylation, reduction and regeneration.

Carboxylation (carbon fixation): the 5-carbon sugar molecule RuBP from carbohydrates pools combine with CO2 to form two 3C molecules, under the catalyzation of the enzyme Rubisco

### What is CUE?

CUE = NPP / GPP = (GPP - R) / GPP, R~a~ = R~g~ (growth respiration) + R~m~ (maintenance respiration), NPP = **Î”** (standing biomass) + losses

Required 2nd review: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01365.x\
Lowest value of CUE (0.22) was for 115 year-old stand of *Picea mariana*, the highest value was for a 5-year-old stand of *Populus nigra* exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2

Boreal forest - CUE 0.32 -\> high rates of C loss during dormant season? can be examined by GPP/foliage ratio\
Tropical forests - CUE 0.46\
Temperate deciduous forests - CUE 0.59

Autotrophic respiration (R~a~) = sum of all mitochondrial respiration by autotrophs.
