Van’t Hoff observed that the rate of chemical reactions changes exponentially with temperature. And the derivative of it in linear relationship. \\[\\frac{d(\\ln k)}{dT} = \\frac{E}{\\mathcal{R}T^2} + c\\]\n1889 Arrhenius built on van’t Hoff’s observations and incorporated the concept of energy distribution among reacting molecules (based on Boltzmann’s statistical mechanics). He simplified van’t Hoff’s equation by assuming c=0 and integrating it into a simpler form to explain reaction kinetics.\n\\[k = d e^{-\\frac{E}{\\mathcal{R}T}}\\]\nWhere d is a constant, E is activation energy, T is the absolute temperature (K). But we would like to involve a reference temperature (283.15K), where standardize the temperature dependencies (enables consistent comparisons across data sets, standardizing variation between ecosystems).\n\\[R = R_{10} e^{\\frac{E}{\\mathcal{R} \\cdot 283.15} \\left(1 - \\frac{283.15}{T}\\right)}\\]\nSoil respiration involves changing populations of many different organisms, each undergoing a complex series of reactions, which is likely that the activation energies may indeed increase with decreasing temperature. Kavanau (1951) utilized kinetic theory to derive a semi-empirical formulation that effectively gives a decrease in activation energy with increasing temperature.\n\\[k_R = P \\left[1 - e^{-\\frac{E_0}{T - T_0}}\\right]\\]\nA simplified version:\n\\[\nR = A e^{-\\frac{E_0}{T - T_0}}\n\\]\nFinal form relative to 10 celsius degree by Lloyd & Taylor, 1994:\n\\[R_{\\text{eco}}(T) = R_{\\text{eco,ref}} e^{E_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{Ref}} - T_0} - \\frac{1}{T - T_0} \\right)}\\]\nThis equation indeed used to calculate Reco at night for nighttime partitioning method.\n1898 Q10: Van’t Hoff in 1898 (p226-228) observed from the data he collected for T (temperature) vs k (reaction rate constant), for many chemical reactions, the k typically increases by a factor of 2 to 3 for every 10°C increase in temperature [T VS. Reaction Rates]. This is in exponential relationship. To further test if reaction rates are in certain times for 10°C intervals, we used: \\(log_{10}k = a +bt\\) & \\((k_{t+10})/k_t = 10^{10b}\\)\nThis make us available to calculate any ratios, such as for ethyl acetate: 9.4°C k=2.307 & 44.94°C k=21.648, sub to \\(log_{10}k = a +bt\\), we are able to calculate b and then \\(10^{10b}\\) to get the ratios.\nThe idea posted by Van’t Hoff was further widely used in ecology study."

Simplified ER parameterization: 1) E0 and Rref remain same through day and night 2) Reco only rely on air or soil T Fail to capture fast environmental change\nWhat the research did? In this study, we show that a new NN framework informed by SIF observations (NNSIF) can tackle two problems simultaneously: (1) partitioning NEE into GPP and ER without prescribed empirical models, and (2) unraveling the GPP-SIF relationship at the ecosystem scale.\nKey concept here: Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is the faint light re-emitted by chlorophyll during photosynthesis under natural sunlight, serving as a passive, remote indicator of plant photosynthetic activity.\nDuring photosynthesis, chlorophyll molecules absorb light energy. This energy can follow three main pathways:1) Drive photochemistry (photosynthesis) – powering electron transport, 2) Be dissipated as heat and 3) Be re-emitted as fluorescence (a small portion, &lt;5%). Thus, GPP can be related to SIF as SIF is a byproduct of the light reactions of photosynthesis, meaning it originates from the same absorbed light energy that drives carbon fixation — so higher photosynthetic activity generally results in stronger SIF signals."

We recommend site specific evaluations to determine which temperature explains most of the variability of the ecosystem respiration (nighttime NEE). As surface temperature showed a good correlation with nighttime NEE, observations of longwave radiation or surface temperature could be a useful extension of the measurements at flux sites.\nImportant Points: Keeping the model’s structure simple is an important goal in order to remain as close as possible to the data, to avoid additional assumptions, and to avoid additional sources of uncertainty.\nFor a subset of sites, observations of the longwave radiation were available and Tsurf could be considered. For this subset of sites, the mean correlation coefficients computed between NEE and different temperature streams were not significantly different. We again observed the Topt had the greatest correlation with nighttime NEE (median = 0.367). For Tmean the median correlation was 0.346, followed by Tsurf derived from longwave radiation (0.339) (no figure). Tsoil, for this subset, showed a stronger correlation (0.332) than the air temperature (0.325).\nMethods on examining correlations:\n\nSliding Window Correlation: 12-day moving window. For each 12-day window, calculated the correlation between nighttime NEE and different temperature variables, half-hourly. Using median correlations\nBuilt linear models and use AIC to check which temperature explains the most variability of NEE\nAIC = n log (RSS/n) + 2 (p+1)"

Vegetation reflects a high amount of NIR (40-60%), absorbs RED (thus reflect less, below 10%) due to chlorophyll. Thus, healthy vegetation has higher NDVI due to high NIR-to-red ratio. Normalization is essential in NDVI to minimize the effects of lighting conditions, sun angle, and atmospheric interference, making vegetation measurements more consistent and comparable across different times and locations. Consider what will happen during a cloudy day vs. sunny day?\nNormalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) introduced by Gao in 1996, defined as \\[NDWI = (NIR-SWIR)/(NIR+SWIR) = [\\rho(0.86\\mu m)-\\rho(1.24\\mu m)] / [\\rho(0.86\\mu m)+\\rho(1.24\\mu m)]\\].

How does this research help Singapore? People might not understand the importance of it. Answer: Singapore aims for carbon neutral by 2050. We don’t have knowledge in tropical forests. 2) The concept between accounting C and C fluxes Answer: Savings vs. Investing 3) Water part? How understanding of the watershed monitoring to help? 4) How sites data complement model prediction and validation? 5) The possibility of erecting a high flux tower (&gt;40m might be too high, flight restriction) - Is the proposed site the best site? - Who take control on constructions? NPARKs+VCA+EIA - Forest site is hard. Think about existing tower. 6) Rationale for grassland site? Answer: To understand what happened across Singapore, we need to understand different ecosystems. - Can never set a permanent site in grassland\n2024/11/23 Notes About Soil Respiration\nSoil Respiration components: root respiration, surface-litter respiration and the respiration of soil organic matter (including root detritus)\n\nLowest soil respiration occur in coldest (tundra & northern bogs) and driest (deserts) biomes, highest in tropical moist forests where both T and moisture availability are high year-round\n\nSoil respiration rates in northern peatlands were shown to be positively correlated with depth to water table by Moore and Knowles (1989) and Luken and Billings (1985)\n\nSoil respiration rates are positively correlated with mean annual air T and mean annual precipitation\n\nFor soil respiration studies Q10 values cited range from 1.3 to 3.3 (Reich & Schlesinger 1992). Based on a review of in situ measurements, the Q10 value for total soil respiration has a median value of 2.4.\nThe turnover time of soil carbon refers to the average time that carbon remains in the soil before being released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide through decomposition. = soil carbon pool / soil respiration rate from the decomposition of soil organic matter (if with assumption live root contribute 30%, then you get soil R * 0.70 for soil organic matter decomposition)\nDiscussion: Ecosystem respiration, collar heights\n03/24 Questions? Why not using nighttime for night data and daytime for day data to solve the light inhibition problem?\nShould we consider this in our research?\nWhy do you think daytime partitioning method is better than nighttime? Uncertainty is larger?\nA scan on CUE related papers and found researchers has been mostly thinking CUE as constant over the last 20 years, too difficult to get the measurements of Ra and NPP. There’s no investigation on CUE for variations across ecosystems and across seasons."

It includes not only the growth of primary producers (biomass accumulation and tissue turnover above and belowground in terrestrial ecosystems) but also the C transfer to herbivores and root symbionts (for example, mycorrhizal fungi), the excretion of organic C from algae, and the production of root exudates and plant VOCs\nPrevious NPP measurements: https://doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0356:MNPPIF]2.0.CO;2\nZanotelli D, Montagnani L, Manca G, Tagliavini M (2013) Net primary productivity, allocation pattern and carbon use efficiency in an apple orchard assessed by integrating eddy covariance, biometric and continuous chamber measurements.

This is called photorespiration and can reduce of 30-50% net CO2 uptake (it depends on the CO2:O2 concentration).\nNPP is GPP minus autotrophic respiration\nBiomass production is the part of NPP that is used for biomass growth (taken to include litter and fruit production). Another part of NPP can be allocated to organic compounds that are not used for growth, including non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs; including starch, sugars and other polysaccharides), labile root exudates (primarily organic acids) that support biological activity in the rhizosphere and secondary metabolites (including biogenic volatile organic compounds) that are involved in signalling, defence against pathogens and herbivores or protection of tissues against thermal oxidative stress.\nGifford (1995) proposed the term ‘carbon use efficiency’ (CUE = 1 − Ra/GPP), which is equivalent to the NPP to GPP ratio as defined by W98."

R increase smaller than P increase\nIn this paper, Gifford (1995) increased CO2 from ambient to 710 PPM, found CUE increased from 0.65 to 0.66"

    "text": "2025/04/04 Measuring Net Primary Production in Forests: Concepts and Field Methods (Clark et al., 2001)\nPurpose: 1) examine how forest NPP (above- and below-ground) can be estimated based on field measurements, 2) assess implications of the limitations of past studies for current perceptions of the amount of NPP in forests globally, 3) how field NPP studies can be used to evaluate tower-based measurements of forest carbon flux\nNPP is defined as the total new organic matter produced during a specified interval.\nNPP measurements: Approach one for individual trees measurements: stand increment = (sum increments of surviving trees) + (sum increments of ingrowth) Ingrowth refers to trees that reached the minimum measurable size during the interval, and their NPP contribution is calculated only from that threshold to avoid overestimation."
