    "text": "Overview: Carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of net primary production (NPP, where NPP = GPP − Ra) to gross primary production (GPP), is a key indicator of how efficiently ecosystems convert assimilated carbon into biomass. Due to the challenges of directly measuring NPP, CUE has often been assumed to be nearly constant across ecosystems over the past two decades. As a result, little attention has been given to its seasonal or temporal variability. However, a recent study has introduced new methods to estimate NPP and autotrophic respiration (Ra) by using ecosystem respiration (Reco) and GPP derived from eddy covariance (EC) data. These approaches suggest that CUE can vary significantly among ecosystems and over time. In this study, I apply this novel method using the refined GPP and Reco data from previous chapter to investigate the seasonal dynamics of both CUE and Ra.\n\n\nShifts in plant respiration and carbon use efficiency at a large-scale drought experiment in the eastern Amazon (Metcalfe et al., 2010)\nResearch gap and question: The effects of drought upon ecosystem structure and function in the Amazon are potentially large but remain poorly defined.-&gt; A range of studies from drought experiments in the Amazon have examined numerous C cycle components in isolation, but none have yet synthesized these individual components to construct a full C budget of a droughted Amazon forest. In this study, to examine the impacts of a large-scale through-fall exclusion (TFE) treatment in an eastern Amazon primary rainforest on ecosystem C cycling and partitioning.\nRelated Concepts: Plant Carbon Expenditure (PCE), total C plants use for processes like respiration and growth: PCE = NPP + Ra Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the total quantity of C entering the forest via photosynthesis GPP ~ PCE ~ Reco under steady-state conditions NTP (net change in tree C balance) = PCE - GPP NTP tells us whether trees are gaining C (NTP &lt; 0), losing C (NTP &gt; 0) or in balance (NTP ~ 0)\nMethods: 1 ha plot (TFE plot) was modified by the installation of plastic panels placed at 1–2 m above the ground,\nCarbon Component How It Was Quantified (Key Method + Instrument) Canopy NPP: Monthly litterfall traps; LAI from hemispherical photos; LMA from harvested leaves. Stem & branch NPP: Annual DBH measurements; biomass from allometric equations; branch fall from transects. Fine root NPP: Soil cores (0–30 cm); roots washed, dried, weighed. Coarse root NPP: Deep soil pits (to 3 m); biomass scaled using depth/diameter ratios. DOC export: Literature value from Amazon catchment study.

The overall effect was a lower ecosystem CUE in the TFE plot of 0.24 ± 0.04 compared with 0.32 ± 0.04 in the control plot (Table 2, Fig. 4).\nDrought reduced carbon allocation to roots and/or increased root mortality, leading to lower below-ground biomass.\n\n\nThrough analysing 26 papers, 60 data points to reject the hypothesis: CUE is constant among forest types.\nDeLUCIA, E.

    "text": "Overview: An eddy covariance (EC) flux tower equipped with gas analyzers continuously measures the exchange of carbon flux between land and atmosphere. With over 1,400 EC towers operating globally, this network plays a key role in monitoring the terrestrial carbon cycle. The CO2 analyzer provides measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), which represents the balance between carbon uptake through photosynthesis (gross primary production, GPP) and carbon release through ecosystem respiration (Reco). However, GPP and Reco are not directly measured and must be estimated by applying partitioning algorithms to the NEE data. Current partitioning methods have limitations in accuracy. In this study, we aim to improve these algorithms by incorporating more precise measurements of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and canopy temperature (Tc).

Predictions still use gapfilled drivers.\nisLasslopPriorsApplied (default TRUE); Applies strong fixed priors/constraints on LRC parameters (α, β, k, Rref) in sparse/ill-conditioned windows.\nsmoothTempSensEstimateAcrossTime (default TRUE), Smooths the nighttime E0(t) estimates across windows before using them in daytime fits.\nisBoundLowerNEEUncertainty (default TRUE); Prevents tiny NEE_SE from giving a few points huge leverage (bounds sdNEE to max(0.2·|NEE|, 0.7)).\nreplaceMissingSdNEEParms (default c(0.2, 0.7)) and neglectNEEUncertaintyOnMissing (default FALSE); If NEE_SE is missing, replace with 20% of |NEE| but at least 0.7; OR if you set neglectNEEUncertaintyOnMissing=TRUE, set all sdNEE=1 when any are missing in a window.\nminNRecInDayWindow (default 10); Minimum valid daytime records per window for fitting. If too high, you get NA windows (lost parameters → more interpolation). Too low → unstable fits.\nisNeglectVPDEffect (default FALSE) and isRefitMissingVPDWithNeglectVPDEffect (default TRUE). If VPD is scarce/missing, auto-refit LRC without VPD and use those parameters for predictions with missing VPD.\nfixedTempSens (E0, sdE0, RRef) If you provide a fixed E0 (and optionally RRef), REddyProc skips nighttime E0 estimation and uses your E0 (with sdE0 for bootstrap).\nuseNightimeBasalRespiration (default FALSE) Implements Keenan (2019) modification: recompute nighttime Reco from nighttime-based Rref rather than daytime basal respiration.\nisNeglectPotRadForNight (default FALSE) Defines night using only Rg≤4 (ignoring potential radiation).\nLRCFitConvergenceTolerance / nLRCFitConvergenceTolerance Optimizer tolerances. Tighter → more precise but slower; looser → faster but slightly different parameters.\nisUsingLasslopQualityConstraints (default FALSE) and minPropSaturation (default NA): Extra data quality checks (beyond original Lasslop constraints) and a “sufficient saturation” criterion.\nnBootUncertainty (default 30) and isSdPredComputed (default TRUE) Bootstrap parameter SDs and propagate to sdReco/sdGPP. 30 is a good balance; set 0 for speed when you don’t need SDs.\n\nInputs and screening: partGLExtractStandardData() and replaceMissingSdByPercentage()\n1) partGLExtractStandardData() as the “clean-room loader” for daytime partitioning. It pulls the right columns from your input ds, applies quality flags the way you ask it to, decides which timesteps are day vs night (Lasslop-style), and prepares a compact data.frame that all later steps use.\nInputs & Controls:\nNEEVar (NEE_f), QFNEEVar (NEE_fqc), QFNEEValue (default 0, which treated as “good/original”), NEESdVar (NEE_fsd)\nTempVar (Tair_f), QFTempVar (Tair_fqc), QFTempValue (as 0),\nVPDVar(VPD_f), QFVPDVar (VPD_fqc), QFVPDValue (as 0),\nRadVar (Rg_f), QFRadVar (Rg_fqc), QFRadValue (as 0),\nPotRadVar (PotRad_NEW)\ncontrolGLPart$isFilterMeteoQualityFlag (default as False), use the filled met drivers as-is\nIf TRUE, replace met drivers with only the “good/original” records per their QC flags; otherwise set to NA\ncontrolGLPart$isNeglectPotRadForNight (default as False), day/night uses both Rg threshold and PotRad sign, TRUE by day/night depends only on Rg threshold\nQuality-flag filtering:\nfSetQF(ds, NEEVar, QFNEEVar, QFNEEValue), returns NEEFiltered: keeps only rows where the QF equals QFNEEValue (usually 0). Others become NA. This ensures daytime LRC fits don’t “trust” gap-filled NEE (consistent with Lasslop).\nMeteo drivers (only if isFilterMeteoQualityFlag == TRUE): NEW_FP_Temp = fSetQF(Tair_f, Tair_fqc, 0) else ds[[“Tair_f”]]; NEW_FP_VPD = fSetQF(VPD_f, VPD_fqc, 0) else ds[[“VPD_f”]]; NEW_FP_Rg = fSetQF(Rg_f, Rg_fqc, 0) else ds[[“Rg_f”]]\nMost people leave isFilterMeteoQualityFlag = FALSE so that filled met drivers drive the prediction stage but are not required to be “original” for fitting (Lasslop’s standard practice still requires original/good NEE for fitting).\nDay/Night Flags:\nRadiation threshold: Rg &gt; 4 → day; Rg ≤ 4 → night (Lasslop 2010)\nPotential radiation guard (to avoid twilight artifacts): If isNeglectPotRadForNight == FALSE (default): isNight = (Rg ≤ 4) & (PotRad ≤ 0); isDay = (Rg &gt; 4) & (PotRad &gt; 0) If TRUE, the PotRad conditions are dropped: isNight = (Rg ≤ 4); isDay = (Rg &gt; 4)\nOutputs:\npartGLExtractStandardData() returns a compact data.frame named (by you) dsR with:\nsDateTime: just ds[[1]] (the first column, usually timestamps; kept for debugging) NEE: quality-filtered NEE (others are NA) sdNEE: standard deviation (uncertainty) of NEE; may be modified next step Temp: temperature series (possibly QC-filtered if you opted in) VPD: VPD series (possibly QC-filtered if you opted in) Rg: radiation series (possibly QC-filtered if you opted in) isDay: logical isNight: logical\n\n\n\nreplaceMissingSdByPercentage() This is a tiny, vectorized helper that fills only the missing entries of a standard deviation vector using a conservative rule tied to the signal magnitude.\nSIGNATURE: replaceMissingSdByPercentage &lt;- function(sdX, x, perc = 0.2, minSdX = 0.7)\nFor every record where the uncertainty (sdNEE) is missing, we fill it with the larger of two values: 20% of the absolute NEE flux magnitude, or 0.7 (the minimum allowed uncertainty).This way, all data points have a reasonable uncertainty estimate for weighting during light-response-curve fitting.\n\nNighttime temperature sensitivity:R/PartitioningLasslop10Nighttime.R\npartGLFitNightTimeTRespSens(), estimate the night-based respiration parameters required by the daytime (Lasslop-style) partitioning: E0, sdE0 and Rref.\nInputs and Windowing:\nInputs: data with columns NEE, Temp (°C), isNight, isDay, (and typically sdNEE, Rg, VPD present).\nWindowing: winSizeNight (default 12 days): length of each night fit window.\nwinSizeRefInDays (default 4 days): reference/anchor window (aligns centers for daytime partitioning, which uses 4 days windows).\nstrideInDays (default 2 days): step between window centers (creates overlap).\nnRecInDay (default 48): records per day (half-hourly data).\nFor robustness, winExtendSizes (default 24 & 48 days), larger windows tried if 12-day fit fails (only if controlGLPart$isExtendTRefWindow = TRUE).\nProcessing STEPS:\n1) Estimate E0 per window. For each window, calls partGLFitNightTempSensOneWindow(), which 1) Filters to valid night records (finite NEE & Temp, isNight=TRUE; optionally trims ≤ −1 °C if enough points); 2) Chooses fit reference temperature TRefFit (median night Temp unless fixed in control); 3) Fits Lloyd–Taylor on (NEE vs Temp) to get E0, sdE0, and RRefFit (at TRefFit). If 𝐸0∉[50, 400] or fit fail E0 = NA\n\n\nRecover failed E0 windows by extending window size (optional). If some E0 are NA and controlGLPart$isExtendTRefWindow=TRUE, repeat Step 2 for larger windows (winExtendSizes, e.g., 24d then 48d) and fill only those windows that were NA.\n\nSanity check for too few valid E0. If fewer than 5 finite E0 and fewer than 10% of windows succeed → stop(); the series is too sparse to proceed.\n\nPreserve raw estimates before smoothing. Copy E0 → E0Fit, sdE0 → sdE0Fit (bookkeeping).\n\nSmooth E0 over time (optional), happened through Year-by-year Gaussian Process smoothing (via mlegp), using sdE0^2 as nugget when controlGLPart$smoothTempSensEstimateAcrossTime = TRUE\n\nEstimate RRef at 15 °C using smoothed E0. alls applyWindows() with partGLFitNightRespRefOneWindow(), With E0 fixed for that window and compute Rref.\n\nFill leading NA in RRef.\n\nReturn the parameter series.\n\nDaytime fitting over moving windows partGLFitLRCWindows(), partGLFitLRCOneWindow()\npartGLFitLRCOneWindow() fits the rectangular hyperbolic LRC in a single daytime window, using E0 (sdE0) and RRef that were determined from nighttime for that same window.\n\npartGLFitLRCWindows() loops over many windows, calls partGLFitLRCOneWindow() repeatedly, collects all results, merges them with the corresponding nighttime E₀ and RRef, and returns one tidy data frame of window-wise parameters.\nThe light-response model families RectangularLRCFitter(), NonrectangularLRCFitter() / LogisticSigmoidLRCFitter()\nBootstrap & Uncertainty .bootStrapLRCFit(), Prediction SDs in partGLInterpolateFluxes()\nFrom windows to HH, partGLInterpolateFluxes(), .partGPAssociateSpecialRows()\nNighttime Reco override & covariances .computeRecoNight(),computeAggregatedCovariance() (helper)\n\nGPP records:\n(Rowland et al., 2014) /Aggregated Canopy Model/ Eastern Amazonian Forest/3756.7 +-19.1 gC m-2 yr-1\n(Zanotelli et al., 2013)/EC/An apple chard/1263 ± 189 gC m-2 yr-1 [Following Reichstein et al. (2005), GPP was 1074, Reco 723 and NEP 351 g C m−2 yr−1.

These electrons are transferred into an electron transport chain.\nStep 2: Water splitting; The oxygen-evolving complex splits 2 water molecules into 4 electrons, 4 protons, and one oxygen molecules. The 4 electrons replace those lost from Photosystem II, the protons accumulate in the thylakoid lumen, and oxygen is released as a byproduct.\nStep 3: Electron transport chain; 4 electrons move through plastoquinone, cytochrome b6f, and plastocyanin. This transfer drives proton pumping into the lumen, further increasing the proton gradient.\nStep 4: Photosystem I and NADPH formation; Electrons reach Photosystem I at a lower energy level and are re-excited by light. They are passed to ferredoxin and then to NADP+ reductase, reducing 2 NADP+ to 2 NADPH.\nStep 5: ATP synthesis; The accumulation of protons in the lumen from water splitting and proton pumping drives their return through ATP synthase, producing about three molecules of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Photosynthesis - Light Reaction\n\n\nIn photosynthesis - calvin cycle stage, carbon fixation happened, which NADPH and ATP are used to convert CO2 into carbohydrates. There are three phases included: caboxylation, reduction and regeneration.\nCarboxylation (carbon fixation): the 5-carbon sugar molecule RuBP from carbohydrates pools combine with CO2 to form two 3C molecules, under the catalyzation of the enzyme Rubisco.\nReduction: the 3C molecules are reduced using ATP and NADPH and then transformed into 3C carbohydrates, a monosaccharide, which is small part exported and then transformed into more complex C compunds\nRegeneration: the large part of 3C compounds not exported is reused and combined using additional ATP to regenrate the 5C-RuBP.\n(Photorespiration happened in the process, which reduce 30-50% net CO2 uptake. Rubisco favors oxygenase, part of them with the energy to produce CO2 instaed of O2)\nRefer to the light energy:\nIncoming solar radiation -&gt; about 43.8% are in PAR wavelengths can be used for photosynthesis\nGibbs free energy to conert a umol CO2 to glucose is 0.47 J, photo energy to assimilate a umol CO2 is 1.75 J -&gt; 27% photosynthetic efficiency for absorbed PAR -&gt; the maximum quantum efficiency is 0.125\nBut actually: 0.081 for C3 plants and 0.040 for C4 plants\nOnly 50% GPP converted to biomass growth -&gt; 1-2% of total solar radiation to biomass build!\nhttps://bio.libretexts.org/Learning_Objects/Worksheets/Biology_Tutorials/Cellular_Respiration\nAutotrophic respiration includes leaf (light+dark), stem and root respiration.\n\nGlycolysis\nKrebs (TCA) cycle\nElectron Transport chain (ETC)\n\n\n\nPCE, GPP, NPP\nGPP=photosynthesis\nPCE=Ra+Growth+Storage+Other uses\n\n\nWhat is CUE?\nCUE = NPP / GPP = (GPP - Ra) / GPP,\nFor Physiological/functional view of Ra, Ra = Rg (growth respiration, the cost of building new tissues) + Rm (maintenance respiration, the cost of keeping existing tissues alive and functional), this view is often used in models (e.g., process-based models, TRENDY, ORCHIDEE, etc) since it links respiration directly to carbon allocation and growth processes.\nFor structural/biometric view of Ra, Ra = Rleaves + Rstems + Rrhizosphere, this decomposition is used in field measurements, because respiration is measured by organ/tissue type rather than by physiological function.\nNPP = Δ (standing biomass) + losses\nRequired 2nd review: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01365.x\nLowest value of CUE (0.22) was for 115 year-old stand of Picea mariana, the highest value was for a 5-year-old stand of Populus nigra exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2\nBoreal forest - CUE 0.32 -&gt; high rates of C loss during dormant season? can be examined by GPP/foliage ratio\nTropical forests - CUE 0.46\nTemperate deciduous forests - CUE 0.59\nAutotrophic respiration (Ra) = sum of all mitochondrial respiration by autotrophs.\nBut actually the biometric measurements BP is commonly used as a proxy for NPP\nVicca et al., 2012 introduce the Biomass production efficiency (BPE) as BP/GPP"

    "text": "Methods on Measuring CUE\n\nGlobal Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM)\nGEM network is a network of sites where the productivity and carbon cycling of terrestrial ecosystems is tracked through a standard protocol, and frequently integrated with data on plant functional traits and broader environmental variables, such as tree species community composition, soil and climate.\n\\[\n\\text{NPP} = \\text{NPP}_{\\text{Above Ground Wood (ACW)}}\n+ \\text{NPP}_{\\text{litter fall}}\n+ \\text{NPP}_{\\text{fine roots}}\n+ \\text{NPP}_{\\text{coarse root}}\n+ \\text{NPP}_{\\text{understory}}\n+ \\text{Herb dung}\n\\]\nNPPACW include NPP from wood production and branch turnover. For wood production, we can calculate from forest censuses on annual scale or using the dendrometer bands at a seasonal scale. Then growth rates can be converted into woody biomass by (Chave et al., 2014): \\(\\ln(\\text{AGB}) = \\alpha + \\beta \\ln(\\rho \\times D^2 \\times H) + \\varepsilon\\) (D is trunk diameter, H is tree height); Fallen branch is compensated by new branch growth, calculate by volume (lengthdiameter)wood density then converted to dry biomass.\nNPPlitterfall is the sum of leaf litterfall (outflow) and changes in canopy leaf biomass (inflow). Litterfall is separated into leaves, twigs, and reproductive parts, dried to biomass, and converted to C (using ~50% of dry mass). At some sites, leaf herbivory is quantified by scanning fallen leaves. Seasonal canopy productivity is derived from canopy leaf area index (LAI, from hemispherical photos) combined with specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area per unit mass) to estimate canopy leaf biomass.\nNPPfine roots is a frequently neglected component of NPP measurements due to the challenge two measure.Two methods are accepted here: 1) installations of root-free ingrowth cores and samples after 3 months (Ingrowth cores → harvest new root dry mass → convert to carbon (~50% of dry mass) → scale by incubation time and ground area → annual NPP) or 2) trace root growth manually at set intervals through rhizotron (a transparent observation panel installed in the soil).\nNPPcoarse roots is not directly measured but estimated by multiplying aboveground woody productivity with biome-specific allometric relationships.\nNPPunderstory is estimated from seasonal quadrat harvests of aboveground herbaceous biomass, dried and converted to C (~50% of dry mass). Productivity is calculated as the sum of positive biomass increments between harvests over the year, excluding declines due to turnover.\nHerb dung = herbivore fecal biomass, included as an NPP component to capture carbon fluxes from herbivory.\n\\[\nR_{a} = R_{\\text{canopy}} + R_{\\text{stems}} + R_{\\text{rhizosphere}}\n\\]\nRstems (woody respiration) is measured using a closed dynamic chamber (SRC-1) connected to an IRGA (EGM-4) on permanent collars sealed to tree boles at 1.3 m height, typically across ~25 trees per plot.\nRcanopy (leaf respiration) is measured as leaf dark respiration with an IRGA and cuvette on ~20 trees per plot, using both sunlit and shaded branches. Branches are re-cut underwater to restore conductivity and leaves are dark-adapted in black bags before measurement.\nRrhizosphere is derived from total soil CO2 efflux measured with an IRGA (EGM-4) and SRC-1 on permanent soil collars. Partitioning experiments use shallow collars (10 cm) for total respiration and deep collars (40 cm) excluding roots and mycorrhizae, with controls for disturbance effects.\n\n\n(Warring et al., 1998)\nNPPa is determined allometric relationships with DBH\nRga = 25% * NPPa\nTBCA = NPProot + Rgroot + Rmroot = f(litterfall) = 130+1.92 * Lf\nNPProot = 0.5TBCA, Rgroot = 0.25TBCA, Rmroot = 0.25TBCA\nRmsapwood = 0.07GPP OR Rmstem&branch = 0.185NPPa\nRmleaves = relationship with nitrogen content of living tissue\nNPP = NPPa + NPProot\nGPP = Rga + Rmleaves + Rmstem&branch + Rgroot + Rmroot + NPPa + NPProot\n(Additional details can be obtained from the original publications. My take away is that: growth respiration = constant construction cost → easy, single multiplier; but maintenance respiration = ongoing cost of living tissue, organ-specific, and environment-dependent)\nProblems here:\n\nRg of Ra is calculated from NPP, and then GPP is calculated from NPP, this lack of independence between estimates of NPP and GPP constrains the possible values of CUE to near 0.5. Thus, the conclusion that CUE is constant may be an artifact (DeLucia et al., 2007; Medlyn & Dewar, 1999)\n\n(Medlyn & Dewar, 1999)\n\\[\n\\frac{NPP}{GPP} =\n\\frac{NPP_a + NPP_{root}}\n{1.435 \\, NPP_a + R_{m(l)} + 2 NPP_{root}}\n= \\frac{1}{2 + a \\,(b - 0.565)} ,\n\\]\nwhere\n- \\(a = \\dfrac{NPP_a}{NPP}\\) is the aboveground fraction of NPP,\n- \\(b = \\dfrac{R_{m(l)}}{NPP_a}\\) is leaf maintenance relative to aboveground NPP.\nThe two main assumption 1) Rgroot + Rmroot = NPProot and 2) Rmstem&branch = 0.185NPPa, lead to 1) artefact CUE with NPP/GPP irrespective of the value a. If b is not 0, higher a could lead to great change of NPP/GPP. However, 2) a with upper limit 0.8, b varies from 0.2-2, CUE is still constrained 0.31-0.59."
