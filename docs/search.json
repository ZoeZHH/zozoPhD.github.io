    "text": "Overview: Carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of net primary production (NPP, where NPP = GPP − Ra) to gross primary production (GPP), is a key indicator of how efficiently ecosystems convert assimilated carbon into biomass. Due to the challenges of directly measuring NPP, CUE has often been assumed to be nearly constant across ecosystems over the past two decades. As a result, little attention has been given to its seasonal or temporal variability. However, a recent study has introduced new methods to estimate NPP and autotrophic respiration (Ra) by using ecosystem respiration (Reco) and GPP derived from eddy covariance (EC) data. These approaches suggest that CUE can vary significantly among ecosystems and over time. In this study, I apply this novel method using the refined GPP and Reco data from previous chapter to investigate the seasonal dynamics of both CUE and Ra.\n\n\n\n\nDoughty, C. E., Goldsmith, G. R., Raab, N., Girardin, C. A. J., Amezquita, F. F., Huaraca‑Huasco, W.

With over 1,400 EC towers operating globally, this network plays a key role in monitoring the terrestrial carbon cycle. The CO2 analyzer provides measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), which represents the balance between carbon uptake through photosynthesis (gross primary production, GPP) and carbon release through ecosystem respiration (Reco). However, GPP and Reco are not directly measured and must be estimated by applying partitioning algorithms to the NEE data. Current partitioning methods have limitations in accuracy. In this study, we aim to improve these algorithms by incorporating more precise measurements of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and canopy temperature (Tc). These refinements are expected to enhance the reliability of carbon flux estimates and deepen our understanding of ecosystem carbon dynamics."
