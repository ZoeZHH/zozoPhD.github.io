Van’t Hoff observed that the rate of chemical reactions changes exponentially with temperature. And the derivative of it in linear relationship. \\[\\frac{d(\\ln k)}{dT} = \\frac{E}{\\mathcal{R}T^2} + c\\]\n1889 Arrhenius built on van’t Hoff’s observations and incorporated the concept of energy distribution among reacting molecules (based on Boltzmann’s statistical mechanics). He simplified van’t Hoff’s equation by assuming c=0 and integrating it into a simpler form to explain reaction kinetics.\n\\[k = d e^{-\\frac{E}{\\mathcal{R}T}}\\]\nWhere d is a constant, E is activation energy, T is the absolute temperature (K). But we would like to involve a reference temperature (283.15K), where standardize the temperature dependencies (enables consistent comparisons across data sets, standardizing variation between ecosystems).\n\\[R = R_{10} e^{\\frac{E}{\\mathcal{R} \\cdot 283.15} \\left(1 - \\frac{283.15}{T}\\right)}\\]\nSoil respiration involves changing populations of many different organisms, each undergoing a complex series of reactions, which is likely that the activation energies may indeed increase with decreasing temperature. Kavanau (1951) utilized kinetic theory to derive a semi-empirical formulation that effectively gives a decrease in activation energy with increasing temperature.\n\\[k_R = P \\left[1 - e^{-\\frac{E_0}{T - T_0}}\\right]\\]\nA simplified version:\n\\[\nR = A e^{-\\frac{E_0}{T - T_0}}\n\\]\nFinal form relative to 10 celsius degree by Lloyd & Taylor, 1994:\n\\[R_{\\text{eco}}(T) = R_{\\text{eco,ref}} e^{E_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{Ref}} - T_0} - \\frac{1}{T - T_0} \\right)}\\]\nThis equation indeed used to calculate Reco at night for nighttime partitioning method.\n1898 Q10: Van’t Hoff in 1898 (p226-228) observed from the data he collected for T (temperature) vs k (reaction rate constant), for many chemical reactions, the k typically increases by a factor of 2 to 3 for every 10°C increase in temperature [T VS. Reaction Rates]. This is in exponential relationship. To further test if reaction rates are in certain times for 10°C intervals, we used: \\(log_{10}k = a +bt\\) & \\((k_{t+10})/k_t = 10^{10b}\\)\nThis make us available to calculate any ratios, such as for ethyl acetate: 9.4°C k=2.307 & 44.94°C k=21.648, sub to \\(log_{10}k = a +bt\\), we are able to calculate b and then \\(10^{10b}\\) to get the ratios.\nThe idea posted by Van’t Hoff was further widely used in ecology study."

Simplified ER parameterization: 1) E0 and Rref remain same through day and night 2) Reco only rely on air or soil T Fail to capture fast environmental change\nWhat the research did? In this study, we show that a new NN framework informed by SIF observations (NNSIF) can tackle two problems simultaneously: (1) partitioning NEE into GPP and ER without prescribed empirical models, and (2) unraveling the GPP-SIF relationship at the ecosystem scale.\nKey concept here: Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is the faint light re-emitted by chlorophyll during photosynthesis under natural sunlight, serving as a passive, remote indicator of plant photosynthetic activity.\nDuring photosynthesis, chlorophyll molecules absorb light energy. This energy can follow three main pathways:1) Drive photochemistry (photosynthesis) – powering electron transport, 2) Be dissipated as heat and 3) Be re-emitted as fluorescence (a small portion, &lt;5%). Thus, GPP can be related to SIF as SIF is a byproduct of the light reactions of photosynthesis, meaning it originates from the same absorbed light energy that drives carbon fixation — so higher photosynthetic activity generally results in stronger SIF signals."

    "text": "2025/04/09 On the choice of driving temperature for eddy-covariance carbon dioxide flux partitioning (Lasslop et al., 2012)\nMain objective: investigate the potential of air and soil temperatures, also surface temperatures, as drivers for night-time partitioning algorithms; quantify the uncertainty and potential biases arising from the choice of the driving temperature for respiration.\nConclusion: The highest performance was achieved with an averaged temperature with optimised weights, in spite of the cost of having an additional parameter. We recommend site specific evaluations to determine which temperature explains most of the variability of the ecosystem respiration (nighttime NEE). As surface temperature showed a good correlation with nighttime NEE, observations of longwave radiation or surface temperature could be a useful extension of the measurements at flux sites.\nImportant Points: Keeping the model’s structure simple is an important goal in order to remain as close as possible to the data, to avoid additional assumptions, and to avoid additional sources of uncertainty.\nFor a subset of sites, observations of the longwave radiation were available and Tsurf could be considered. For this subset of sites, the mean correlation coefficients computed between NEE and different temperature streams were not significantly different. We again observed the Topt had the greatest correlation with nighttime NEE (median = 0.367). For Tmean the median correlation was 0.346, followed by Tsurf derived from longwave radiation (0.339) (no figure). Tsoil, for this subset, showed a stronger correlation (0.332) than the air temperature (0.325).\nMethods on examining correlations:\n\nSliding Window Correlation: 12-day moving window. For each 12-day window, calculated the correlation between nighttime NEE and different temperature variables, half-hourly. Using median correlations\nBuilt linear models and use AIC to check which temperature explains the most variability of NEE\nAIC = n log (RSS/n) + 2 (p+1)"

    "text": "2025/04/10 Revisiting the choice of the driving temperature for eddy covariance CO2 flux partitioning (Wohlfahart & Galvagno, 2016)\nMain objective: revisit the effects related to the choice of the driving temperature on inferred GPP and Reco\nMethods:\nUsing grassland and temperatures for surface temperaturem, soil temperature at 0.02m and 0.1m\n1) Seperate daytime, nighttime Reco for the same temeprature, to compare\nIf different -&gt; there is sth other than light inhibition problem, is that interchangeable for Reco, day and Reco, night, both used a temperature?\n2) Fit in the logtransformed Reco and T to llyod equation, check slopes (how sensitive Reco is to T change) and y-intercepts (Reco at reference T) between day and night Reco -&gt; Check if Reco responds to temperature in the same way during both day and night\nOpaque chambers for daytime and nighttime measurements -&gt; mimic the daytime, nighttime Reco extrapolated from the Llyod equations\nKey findings:\n\nThe diurnal course of Reco, in contrast, reflects the additive contributions of both below- and aboveground respiration (Eq. (1)) and reaches minima/maxima after that of air and before that of soil temperature (Fig. 1a).\n\nTs (explains Rbg; more likely influence the Reco at night)\nTa (explains Rag; more likely influence Reco at day)\nIf using Ts to estimate the Reco for day -&gt; daytime Ta responds faster -&gt; underestimate the Reco at day\nIf using Ta to estimate the Reco for day -&gt; Ta changes fast but Reco not that fast since a big portion from Rbg, thus steeper E0, overestimate the Reco.\nThus, nighttime Reco is overestimated based on soil temperature and underestimated based on air temperature\nThe magnitude of the over or underestimation depends on 1) phase shift between Ts and Ta (time lag between their daily maxima (or minima) during a typical diurnal cycle) and 2) the magnitude of soil and above-ground respiration"
